# weightedattri
Doing weighted digital marketing attribution modelling in R, giving impressions half the weight of clicks. It takes the number of times the placement appears in the conversion path, and then assigns the revenue value to it based on the weights. Placements that are impressions must have "(Impression)" in the name.
